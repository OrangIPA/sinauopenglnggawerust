# Learn OpenGL with rust
This is my learning opengl journey with rust, from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com)

## Why rust?
because cpp build system is shit and i refuse to learn cmake

# How to build
note to self: 
install `extra-cmake-modules`, `wayland-devel`, `wayland-protocols-devel`, `libxkbcommon-devel` for fedora
if wanna build for wayland
